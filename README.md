## Telecom Analytics Use Cases ##

  1. **Improve customer experience**

  A detailed analysis of telecom data can help businesses to identify factors that impact customer experience. Telecom analytics helps companies to collate and analyze data       obtained from call centers, CRM systems, and other sources to understand the biggest pain points of their customers.
  
  2. **Reduce truck rolls through proactive customer care**

Using telecom analytic solutions, businesses can generate customized reports based on what-if scenarios and data clustering algorithms, thereby avoiding unnecessary service calls and in-person appointments which could otherwise cost them several dollars.

  3. **Analyze the potential of new offerings**

Telecom analytics solutions that leverage predictive modeling act as a key enabler of business success by helping telcos develop innovative offerings to generate new revenue streams based on customer preferences.

  4. **Reduce customer churn rate**

Telecom analytics leverages big data and advanced analytics tools to identify factors or events that impact churn. Using such insights, businesses can deploy suitable strategies to prevent churn and improve satisfaction rates.
In this project we will analyze a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers and their activities on the network. This will help our employer to analyze opportunities for growth and make a decision whether to buy the telecommunication company.
